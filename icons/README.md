# Icons

These are Windows icons that I made when I was in high school, ca. 2004. There is also a `.ani` file, which is an animated cursor for web links.

## Context

A lot of these icons are related to classes I took in high school:

- AD.ico - Academic Decathlon
- Chapter Review.ico - A segment of history class
- Economics.ico
- Fall.ico
- Foot.ico - A reference to Yearbook
- School.ico
- Spring.ico
- Summer.ico
- Winter.ico

or are specific to the way I organized my documents in high school:

- Comics.ico
- GIFS.ico
- Life In General.ico
- My Creations.ico
- My Icons.ico
- My Jumpdrive.ico
- Old Documents.ico
- Other Documents.ico
- Silly Documents.ico
- Wallpaper.ico

A few of them are specific to a zine I made with my friends about a made-up extreme sport called "extreme hammocking" - called "Extreme Hammocking Magazine", of course, or EHM for short:

- BHPH 1.ico
- BHPH 2.ico
- BHPH 3.ico
- BHPH 4.ico
- EHM.ico

BHPH was a game I wanted to make for extreme hammocking, in the vein of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, called Boone Howard's Pro Hammocker.

Yet others were for different kinds of programs I had, or programs I ran without native icons:

- DOS Program.ico
- [Dark Woods II.ico](https://dosgames.com/game/dark-woods-2/)
- NetHack.ico
- Rogue.ico

As for the rest? For the most part, I don't really remember. Some of them might have just been for fun, honestly.

## Viewing

The .ico files are readily viewable in most image viewers. The `.ani` file may be a bigger challenge. I previewed it using this website:

## Converting

You may have an intended use for these icons in a modern context. If you need to convert them to, say, png, `imagemagick` has you covered. For example:

```sh
magick EHM.ico EHM.png
```

## License

Not that anyone would want to use these, but if you do, the license is cc-by-sa-4.0. For more details, look at the `LICENSE` file.
