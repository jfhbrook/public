A Quick Series of Notes on Things:

1) Everything here's on the wtfpl.

2) report\report.pdf should have pretty much anything interesting regarding How
Shit Works. It should also clear up the "why" aspect of things.

3) Yeah, there are a lot of useless files here. >_<

4) The interesting files to actually Check Out are sfbe.py and
sfbe_plotter.(gnumeric|xls) . promblems.py uses sfbe.py to run some example
problems.
