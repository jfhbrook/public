Every semester, at [UAF](http://www.uaf.edu), the students fill out [bubble sheets](http://www.washington.edu/oea/services/course_eval/forms/) describing their experiences in each class.  I learned this semester that reports from the data are actually publically available! So, I went to the [ASUAF](http://asuaf.org) office and got myself hooked up with the last five years of reports!

That's what the .pdf files are. I started hand-copying some entries I was interested in (professors from my home department) to data.gnumeric, but quickly grew tired of it. That, and I found that I had *no idea* what to actually **do** with the data.

That's where _you_ come in! Find a good way to scrape this data and visualize it---and then let me know about it so I can learn! Or, y'know, don't. Either way. :)
