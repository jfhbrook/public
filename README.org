repository]].
* Contents
** anisotropy
This submodule contains my masters thesis. It is licensed under the Community
Research and Academic Programming License v0 Beta 0.
** college
These are various projects I worked on in college. Each project is "poorly
licensed" - ~count_crossings~ and ~nomograms~ have no licensing information at
all and ~super-four-bar-explorer~ has "Everything here's on the wtfpl" in the
comments - but if someone really needs it I'm happy to add licensing
information. Let me know.
** data
This folder contains various free datasets - currently this contains the IAS
student survey results for the University of Alaska Fairbanks from 2005 to 2009,
in difficult-to-parse .pdf form. Sorry y'all.
** db_hooks
This is the toolset I made for myself to manage database stuff on my personal
machines. It is licensed under an Apache v2.0 license with additional
restrictions. See the included NOTICE file for details.
** de-discord
This repo is a gitops repo for a Data Engineering Discord that I moderate. The
Python code has an Apache 2.0 v2.0 license, but the emojis are "poorly
licensed". See the included NOTICE file for details.
This is stuff I'm working on for my Linux desktop. It is available under a MPL
v2.0 license with additional restrictions. See the included NOTICE files for
details.

source-available.

** hacks
Herein lie my open source hack projects!
*** alacritty-theme-tester
This is a series of kludgy scripts I wrote for testing out themes with
Alacritty, the terminal I use in Linux. It is licensed under a MIT license.
*** ihydra
This is a sabbatical project I worked on in Spring 2020 that contains a Jupyter
kernel for [[https://hydra-editor.glitch.me/][the Hydra visual synthesizer]]. It uses the same license as the
IJavascript kernel - that is, under a BSD 3-clause license.
** korben-twitter

It's written in rust, and licensed under an Apache 2.0 license.
** korbenware
A collection of scripts I use to glue my Linux desktop and general CLI experience
together. Available under a MPL v2.0 license.
** old-memes
old memes is an old-school Node.js anti-framework built around the good parts
of [[https://github.com/flatiron][flatiron]], a selection of classic [[https://github.com/substack][substack]] libraries and the few worthwhile
things I personally wrote between roughly 2009 and 2016 - with a targeted
dash of modern conveniences. It's a big project, so see [[./README.md][its README]] for more details.
** openscad
These are files I've written for OpenSCAD. So far, these are available under a
MPL v2.0 license with additional restrictions. See the included NOTICE file for
details.
** politics
These are projects I've done for political organizations.
*** ak-demo-favicon
This is an icon I made for the Alaska Young Democrats in 2013, intended to be
used by progressive and democratic-aligned people and organizations in Alaska
and inspired by the JavaScript logo. It's licensed under a Creative Commons CC0
1.0 Universal License.
*** nys-data-dump-howto.org
Are you a leftist organization in New York State and interested in working with
their open electoral data? This document details how to get your hands on
campaign disclosure reports and voter files and successfully load them into a
database for further exploration and processing. It is licensed under an
Anti-Capitalist Software License.
** PSeudo
This is a PowerShell module for privilege escalation in Windows 10, using named
pipes and a bunch of dirty tricks. It is based on code I found and saved from
the internet. It is licensed under an MIT Expat license with additional
restrictions. See the LICENSE file for details.
** pyee
This is a loose port of the Node.js EventEmitter with special support for
coroutines and concurrent programming. It is licensed under an MIT license.
** resume
This is my resume! This repository contains PDFs for my standard one-page resume
and a longer CV. It's written in LaTeX.
** trophies
This folder contains projects that I don't maintain anymore but that I'm proud
of and want to showcase.
*** ecstatic
Ecstatic is a static fileserving middleware for Node.js that I maintained from
2011 to 2019, with over 900 stars on GitHub. I shut down the project in May 2019
[[https://github.com/jfhbrook/node-ecstatic/issues/259][in a big huff]]. It is licensed under an MIT license.
*** hoarders
Hoarders was a joke module I made as commentary around "grab bag utility
modules" like underscore in the Node.js ecosystem around 2013. It was intended
to make close friends laugh, but ended up getting the attention of most module
maintainers on npm, making a number of them [[https://github.com/jfhbrook/hoarders/issues/2][pretty angry]]. Eventually, it was
discovered that starring the package would freeze the npm registry, and Isaac
deleted it from npm.

Hoarders is licensed under the Tumbolia Public License.
*** nodeboats_2015
At JSConf 2015, I teamed up with some friends to make a nodeboat with a sail on
it. The SS. Duplicate Callback, if memory serves, did about as well in the
competition as you could trying to control a boat over hotel wifi. Sadly, I
don't have pictures.
** twisted_ipython
This is a module that makes autoawait work in IPython using Twisted. It is
licened under a BSD 3-clause license with additional restrictions. See
the included NOTICE file for details.

For more information, read [[https://dev.to/jfhbrook/twistedipython-autoawait-in-jupyter-notebooks-with-twisted-lee][the blog post on dev.to]].
