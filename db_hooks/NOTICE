- Google and Alphabet - This is for many reasons, up to and including the
  gutting of the Ethical AI team at Google, including the firings of
  Timnit Gebru and Meg Mitchell
- Facebook, for their irresponsible handling of false information and right
  wing extremism on their platform especially following the 2016 presidential
  election
- GitHub, for their contracts with ICE

This list overrides any license that may be granted by other portions of this
