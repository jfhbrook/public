# packages

These files configure some packages I'm building on COPR. This folder might
end up managing other registries as well, but for now it's just COPR.

Note that this folder only contains builds for packages I don't own. Individual
projects will have their own files for configuring COPR.

You can look at a full list of my COPR packages here:
