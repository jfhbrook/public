# TODO

So at this point, I more or less have things shaped the way I want them.

Next seps are to make `just test` actually work end-to-end locally. I did a
lot of HACKING and that feels good, but I haven't actually pulled any levers.
Once that's done, it'll be time to see what COPR will do with it! If *that*
works, then we're done - and what will we have?

We'll have the framework for building a little DSL for doing up `make srpm`
based COPR builds in the public repo. If that works and I wanna use it for
other repos, I can always turn it into a template or something!
