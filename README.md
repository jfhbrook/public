### old-memes

old memes is an old-school Node.js anti-framework built around the good parts
of [flatiron](https://github.com/flatiron), a selection of classic [substack](https://github.com/substack) libraries and the few worthwhile
things I personally wrote between roughly 2009 and 2016 - with a targeted
dash of modern conveniences. It's a big project, so see [its README](./old-memes/README.md) for more
details.

### omsxctl
