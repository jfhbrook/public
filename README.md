# nodeboats 2015

Code for controlling a very specific nodeboat---the S.S. Duplicate Callback, a **sailboat**!

## some things

1. `npm start` pretty much works
2. Follow the directions to get controls working
3. <- and -> control the rudder
4. ^ and v control the trim
5. The repl works---look at board.rudder and board.sail for controls
6. brohonestly, wifi/particle connectivity will be your biggest enemies
