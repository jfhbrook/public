## Development

The PSGallery package is in the root of this directory. Development is fairly
straightforward. There's also a [justfile](https://github.com/casey/just) that
includes some common recipes.

`just install` will install powershell dev dependencies to your user. Right
now, that's just ScriptAnalyzer.

`just console` will start powershell with the module imported. From there, you
can try running it against the production API.

`just format` will format both the powershell and terraform code, in all
parts of the project.

`just publish` will publish the module to PSGallery. Note you'll need to set
`NUGET_API_KEY` in `.env`.

Recipes relevant to app development are `just start` and `just deploy`. See
[the dedicated README](./service/README.md) for more details.

Verbtionary also includes [an Azure function app](./service) and
[accompanying infrastructure](./infrastructure). These have brief READMEs with
more details of their use.
